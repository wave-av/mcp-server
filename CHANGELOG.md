## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `pr-agent` lane: fork-triggered `/` commands are now refused, and the AI
  call's budget fits inside its step. Three defects, one of them only visible
  once the first was fixed.

  The job-level `if:` refused forks on the `pull_request` arm and could not on
  `issue_comment` — fork status is absent from that payload, so there was never
  an expression to write. A `fork gate` step now asks the pulls endpoint and
  fails closed: only a literal `false` proceeds, so a 404, a rate limit or a
  deleted fork all skip. The lane runs no `actions/checkout`, so fork code was
  never executed and no exfiltration path existed; what this closes is the
  comment claiming forks were already skipped, which was true of one arm only.

  `CONFIG__AI_TIMEOUT` was 600s inside a 360s step, so the runner killed the
  step before pr-agent could reach its own timeout or fall back to a secondary
  model. Now 300s.

  Fixing the first exposed a third: `stamp attempt 2 end` runs under
  `if: always()`, so when attempt 2 never ran the verdict subtracted from zero
  and reported a 1787580408-second attempt as a confident TIMED OUT.

  Contributors on forks are affected: a maintainer's `/review` on a fork PR is
  now declined with a warning rather than silently running.
  (wave-av/wave-foundation-public#73)

- The build now emits the TypeScript declaration files (`dist/index.d.ts`,
  `dist/sdk-server.d.ts`) that `package.json` has been advertising via `types`
  and the `exports` map. Previously consumers silently resolved to `any`. The
  release workflow now verifies the declared types entries exist in the packed
  tarball before publishing. Note: `dist/sdk-server.d.ts` type-references the
  optional `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` peer dependency, so type-checking
  an import of `@wave-av/mcp-server/sdk-server` without that package installed
  now fails with TS2307 (instead of silently resolving to `any`); install the
  peer dependency to consume that subpath.

### Changed

- Releases are now published via npm trusted publishing (OIDC) with signed
  provenance attestations, replacing token-based authentication in CI.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- In-process Claude Agent SDK server via the new `@wave-av/mcp-server/sdk-server`
  subpath export (`createWaveSdkMcpServer()`). Skips the stdio subprocess hop for
  consumers already running inside an Agent SDK session. `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
  is an **optional** peer dependency — stdio-only consumers are unaffected.

### Changed

- Tools are now declared once as data (`WaveToolDef[]`) in each area module and
  aggregated in `src/tools/index.ts` (the single source of truth). Both the stdio
  server and the in-process SDK server iterate that one list, guaranteeing 18/18
  parity across transports. The previously duplicated `waveFetch` / content
  helpers are hoisted to `src/tools/shared.ts`.
